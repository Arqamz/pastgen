# **Pastgen** - Parser and AST Generator

**Pastgen** is a **generic parser and abstract syntax tree (AST) generator** designed for any context-free grammar (CFG). It allows users to input any CFG, choose their desired parsing method, and automatically generates parsing tables, ASTs, and intermediate code for the given grammar.
